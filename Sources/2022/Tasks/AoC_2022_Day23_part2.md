## --- Part Two ---
It seems you're on the right track. Finish simulating the process and figure out where the Elves need to go. How many rounds did you save them?
 
In the example above, the **first round where no Elf moved** was round `20`:
 

```
.......#......
....#......#..
..#.....#.....
......#.......
...#....#.#..#
#.............
....#.....#...
..#.....#.....
....#.#....#..
.........#....
....#......#..
.......#......
```

 
Figure out where the Elves need to go. **What is the number of the first round where no Elf moves?**
