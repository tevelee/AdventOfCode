## --- Part Two ---
Sometimes, it's a good idea to appreciate just how big<!--- The deepest parts of the ocean are about as deep as the altitude of a normal commercial aircraft, roughly 11 kilometers or 36000 feet. --> the ocean is. Using the [Manhattan distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry), how far apart do the scanners get?
 
In the above example, scanners `2` (`1105,-1205,1229`) and `3` (`-92,-2380,-20`) are the largest Manhattan distance apart. In total, they are `1197 + 1175 + 1249 = 3621` units apart.
 
**What is the largest Manhattan distance between any two scanners?**
